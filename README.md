# AdventOfCode2020
A repository of my solutions, in python, for the Advent Of Code 2020's puzzle

I would like to git that, obviously after the deadline, to show my reflection and learn from other contributors about what it's possible to do.

I would to warn you, Advent Of Code (https://adventofcode.com/) is a speed contest Advent calendar of small programming puzzles.
Each puzzles are opened at 6am UTC+1, so I don't have all right mecanics when I'm wake up to solve it.
However I would share with you that.
